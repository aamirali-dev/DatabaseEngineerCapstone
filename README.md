# Database Engineering Capstone Project - Little Lemon Booking System

Welcome to the Little Lemon Booking System Database Engineering Capstone Project! In this comprehensive project, we have designed and implemented a powerful booking system for Little Lemon, showcasing our expertise in database engineering, SQL querying, Python integration, and Tableau data analytics. Our project empowers Little Lemon with a seamless booking solution and insightful data visualizations.

## Project Overview

Throughout this capstone project, we have successfully accomplished the following milestones:

1. **Data Modeling:** We meticulously designed a logical and efficient data model for Little Lemon, ensuring proper identification of attributes, primary keys, and relationships. This model forms the foundation for storing and managing booking-related data.

2. **Database Implementation:** We took the logical data model further and created a physical data model with precise data types and constraints. Using MySQL Workbench's Forward Engineer method, we seamlessly deployed the physical data model to the MySQL server, establishing a robust and reliable database system.

3. **SQL Queries:** Our skillful use of SQL queries allowed us to manage and summarize booking data effectively. We tackled various tasks, such as creating virtual tables, extracting complex information through JOIN clauses, and implementing procedures to handle critical booking operations.

4. **Tableau Data Analytics:** Utilizing Tableau's powerful capabilities, we performed insightful data analytics. Our Tableau workbook showcases a variety of charts and dashboards that visualize booking trends, sales data, and customer insights. We transformed raw data into meaningful visualizations that provide actionable insights for Little Lemon's business decisions.

5. **Python Integration:** We set up a Python client project, leveraging the Connector/Python library to connect with the MySQL database. Our Python procedures efficiently interact with the database, executing operations like making bookings, checking and updating bookings, and more.

6. **GitHub Repository:** All project components, including the data model, SQL queries, Python procedures, and Tableau workbook, are meticulously organized within our GitHub repository. This facilitates easy access, collaboration, and peer review.

## Project Components

Our project repository contains the following essential components:

1. **Logical and Physical Data Model:** We designed a comprehensive data model, translating it into a physical schema for MySQL deployment.

2. **SQL Queries:** A collection of SQL queries, including complex JOIN statements, virtual table creation, and procedure implementation.

3. **Python Procedures:** Python procedures that seamlessly interact with the MySQL database, performing key booking operations.

4. **Tableau Workbook:** An interactive Tableau workbook that offers various data visualizations, revealing insightful patterns and trends.

## Getting Started

To explore and appreciate the depth of our capstone project, follow these steps:

1. **Data Model Exploration:** Review the logical and physical data models. Understand the entity relationships, primary keys, and attributes that form the backbone of the Little Lemon booking system.

2. **SQL Queries Mastery:** Study the SQL queries we implemented to manage and analyze booking data. Explore the use of JOIN clauses, virtual tables, and stored procedures.

3. **Python Procedures:** Examine our Python procedures, which enable seamless interaction with the database. Gain insights into how key booking operations are executed using Python.

4. **Tableau Insights:** Open the Tableau workbook and immerse yourself in the world of data analytics. Navigate through different charts and dashboards to extract meaningful insights from the booking data.

5. **GitHub Repository:** Access our GitHub repository to delve deeper into the project components, review code, and explore the documentation.

## Review Criteria

As part of the peer review process, our project was evaluated based on:

- Successful creation and organization of the GitHub repository.
- Clarity and effectiveness of the logical and physical data models.
- Appropriateness and functionality of SQL queries and procedures.
- Quality and informative nature of Tableau visualizations.
- Integration of Python procedures and successful connection with the MySQL database.
